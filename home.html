						<h4>Pete</h4>
						<p>Don't be fooled by his tough exterior! Pete is about as sweet as they come. He loves to have his mohawk brushed!!!!</p>
					</li>
					<li><img src="img/human2.png" alt="Placeholder">
						<h4>Beatrice</h4>
						<p>Beatrice is an oldie but goodie. She needs a home with a dedicated caretaker that can spend a lot of time with her. Beatrice is very sweet but has shown she doesn't do well training, she gets very distracted. Also, she LOVES cookies!</p>
